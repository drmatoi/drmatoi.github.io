##  - Mr.Matoi´s Site
My goal is to make controversial content easier to find on the internet, we are aware that many do not support this and condemn it, but we don't care. We provide all the links for such controversial topics so you don't have to search for them. We are clearly against censorship or excessively expensive products from companies that have surreal sales anyway. Everyone should decide for themselves what they want to share or pay. Everyone should know how the things they use work. Data trading and fraud are a big problem of the Internet, which often come up with topics we share, so we provide secure sites so that you don't have to put yourself in danger. Of course, we are against illegal actions and do not want to call for them, but I would like to refer back to our motto here. Not everything that is forbidden is wrong!<b> - Sincerly founder Matoi </b>
<br>
We always try to keep the lists up to date and add to them regularly. I apologize for the small selection of topics at the moment, but that's because this website is still at the beginning of its time<b> - MORE SOON! </b>

NEW LAYOUT PUBLISHED NOW!
